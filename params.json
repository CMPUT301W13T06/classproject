In addition you'll need to set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the location of your SDK:\r\n\r\n`export ANDROID_HOME=~/tools/android-sdk`\r\n\r\nAfter satisfying those requirements, the build is pretty simple:\r\n(a connected device is required)\r\n\r\n* Run `mvn clean package` from the `app` directory to build the APK only\r\n* Run `mvn clean install` from the root directory to build the app and also run the integration tests, this requires a connected Android device or running emulator\r\n* Run `mvn clean verify` from the root directory to build the app, run the integration tests, and run checkstyle\r\n* Run ./test-cli.sh, to build the app, run integration tests and view the output in a web browser\r\n* Run ./test-cli-windows.sh (on Windows), to build the app, run integration tests and view the output in a web browser\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\n  * [ActionBarSherlock](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock) for a consistent, great looking header across all Android platforms.\r\n  * [ViewPagerIndicator](https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator) for swiping between fragments.\r\n  * [NineOldAndroids](https://github.com/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids) for view animations.\r\n  * [RoboGuice](http://code.google.com/p/roboguice/) for dependency-injection.\r\n  * [Robotium](http://code.google.com/p/robotium/) for driving our app during integration tests.\r\n  * [android-maven-plugin](https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin) for automating our build and producing release-ready APKs.\r\n  * [Otto](https://github.com/square/otto) - An event bus for publish subscribe style communication between application components\r\n  * [fest-android](https://github.com/square/fest-android) - For fluent assertions\r\n  * [AndroidBootstrap](http://www.androidbootstrap.com/) - for generating the template of our source code.\r\n  * [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/f2prateek/FoodBot) for continuous integration\r\n  * [http-request](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/http-request) A simple convenience library for using a HttpURLConnection.\r\n  * [Spoon](http://square.github.com/spoon/) - for making sense of our instrumentation tests\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nPlease fork this repository and contribute back using [pull requests](https://github.com/CMPUT301W13T06/classproject/pulls).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
